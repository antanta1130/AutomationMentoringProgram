Solving Quadratic equation
𝑎𝑥^2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0
𝑥_1,2=(−𝑏±√(𝑏^2−4𝑎𝑐))/2𝑎
Declare three double variables a,b and c
Initialize them while declaring
Declare two double variables x1 and x2
Assign them with solved roots
Note: please use Math.sqrt() for taking square root
Note: use System.out.println() for output

1. By using the bubble sort algorithm, write a Java program to sort an integer array of 10 elements in ascending.
2. Find if number belongs to the array using binary search algorithm (Hint: use bubble sort from previous task)

Optional tasks
1. Write a program called CheckOddEven which prints "Odd Number" if the intvariable “number” is odd, or “Even Number” otherwise. 
2. Write a program called PrintNumberInWord which prints "ONE", "TWO",... , "NINE", "OTHER" if the int variable "number" is 1, 2,... , 9, or other, respectively. 
3. Write a program called SumAndAverage to produce the sum of 1, 2, 3, ..., to 100. Also compute and display the average. 
4. Write a program called ComputePI to compute the value of π (compare it with Math.PI)
5. Write a program called HarmonicSum to compute the sum of a harmonic series, as shown below, where n=50000
